-- Problem 1: Use the `GROUP BY` clause with the `COUNT()` aggregate function to query the song table for the number of songs by each artist. The result of the query should have two columns: the artist, and the count(song) of the artist.
-- HINT: You should avoid using the wild card (*) in your statement. All projected columns must either be used in the `GROUP BY` clause or an aggregate function.

-- Write your sql statement anywhere below this line
