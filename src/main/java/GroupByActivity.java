/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DQL (Data Query Language)
 *
 * NOTE: Before attempting this activity, you should have already completed the
 * Aggregate Functions activities.
 *
 * The GROUP BY clause allows you to group your results and can be used with the ORDER BY clause. Group By is
 * used in conjunction with aggregate functions. However, you cannot group by the output of the function.
 * Recall that the output of an aggregate function is a single aggregate value.
 *
 *
 *   employee table
 *   |  id  |     employee   |   manager    |  salary  |
 *   --------------------------------------------------
 *   |1     |'Steve'         |'Dave'        |67400.00  |
 *   |2     |'Alexa'         |'Dave'        |42500.00  |
 *   |3     |'Sarah'         |'Jane'        |99890.99  |
 *   |4     |'Brandon'       |'Jane'        |120000    |
 *   |5     |'Adam'          |'Dave'        |55050.50  |
 *
 * Example: You could query the above table with the AVG() aggregate function and GROUP BY manager to find the
 * average salary of employees under that manager (then order it from greatest average salary to least):
 *      SELECT manager, AVG(salary)
 *      FROM employees
 *      GROUP BY manager
 *      ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
